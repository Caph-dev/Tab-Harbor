# Tab Harbor Changes

[简体中文](README.md) | [English](README.en.md)

This fork keeps the original Tab Harbor idea, but this README only records the changes made in this branch.

## What Changed

### Chrome Sync Summary

- Added cross-device sync through `chrome.storage.sync`, with no custom server.
- Sync requires both devices to use the same Google Chrome account, Chrome Sync to be enabled, and Extensions or related extension data to be allowed in Chrome Sync settings.
- Both devices must install Tab Harbor with the same extension ID. `chrome.storage.sync` data is isolated by extension ID, so different IDs do not share the same synced data.
- Chrome Sync itself is not isolated by extension version, but keeping both devices on the same extension version is recommended so older code does not misread newer sync fields, delete tombstones, or order data.
- Saved-for-later items sync URL, title, completed / archived / deleted state, and order.
- Todos sync title, description, completed / archived / deleted state, and order.
- Quick shortcuts under the search bar sync URL, label, order, icon type, icon mask, and lightweight icons.
- Large shortcut icon images are not written to Chrome Sync; they stay in the local cache to avoid Chrome Sync per-item quota limits.
- `chrome.storage.local` remains a local cache and legacy data backup. Deletes are stored as tombstones so stale data from another device does not revive removed items.

### Shortcut icon editor

- Added icon mask controls for quick shortcuts.
- Added global shortcut icon size and corner-radius sliders.
- Added a website icon search action that looks for usable favicons, Apple touch icons, and fallback favicon services from the shortcut URL.
- Improved custom image / SVG rendering so rounded icons fill the mask more cleanly.
- Added middle-click support for quick shortcuts so a shortcut can open in a background tab.

### Visual direction

- Switched the editorial display typography from the remote Libre Caslon font to local editorial fonts:
  - `Test Tiempos Text`
  - `方正FW筑紫A老明朝 简`
- Tuned the greeting, date, drawer counts, group titles, and footer typography to use the local editorial stack.
- Reduced the default quick shortcut chrome so icons can read more like a quiet icon rail instead of small cards.

### Drawer and dashboard details

- Adjusted the saved drawer width so it has more breathing room on wider screens.
- Let todo text wrap to two lines instead of forcing single-line truncation.
- Updated the duplicate Tab Harbor banner copy so it appears only when there are 3 or more Tab Harbor tabs open.
- Added missing i18n hooks for saved-for-later and todo empty states.
- Moved the desk settings and pinned-order controls out of the top group navigation row and into quiet floating controls at the bottom-right of the page.
- Kept the group navigation inside the left open-tabs column so the right rail can move upward into the space freed by those controls.
- Updated the theme menu to open upward from the bottom-right controls, with a fixed mobile placement so it stays inside the viewport and avoids the drawer triggers.
- Tuned the right-side search box spacing so its top border visually aligns with the divider line in the left open-tabs section header.
- Made the right drawer feel more immediate by opening the shell first, then refreshing only the active drawer view after paint.
- Added a drawer speed slider to Desk settings, with a faster default and persisted 1-5 speed levels.
- Added UI regression coverage for the new group navigation placement, bottom-right floating controls, upward theme menu, search spacing, drawer open path, and drawer speed setting.

### Popup experience

- Synced shortcut icon sizing and mask variables into the extension popup.
- Updated popup rendering/tests for the shortcut icon mask behavior.
- Kept popup styling aligned with the quieter shortcut icon treatment.

### Privacy page

- Updated the privacy page typography to match the local editorial font stack.

## Current Diff Scope

Compared with upstream `V-IOLE-T/tab-harbor@main`, this branch currently changes:

- `extension/drawer-sync-store.js`
- `extension/quick-shortcuts-sync-store.js`
- `extension/theme-controls.js`
- `extension/style.css`
- `extension/index.html`
- `extension/popup/popup.js`
- `extension/popup/popup.css`
- `extension/popup/popup.html`
- `extension/drawer-manager.js`
- `extension/dashboard-runtime.js`
- `extension/i18n.js`
- `extension/manifest.json`
- sync, shortcut, popup, theme, drawer, todo, and UI regression tests
- `privacy.html`

## Validation

Relevant validation command:

```bash
node --test extension/*.test.js extension/popup/*.test.js
```

For script-loading or startup changes, also verify the extension in Chrome because this project uses ordered plain script tags rather than a bundler.

## Notes

The recent GitHub feedback noted that the plain HTML/CSS/JS structure is becoming harder to maintain. This branch does not convert the project to Vue or another framework; it keeps the current architecture and focuses on a narrower set of UI, interaction, and sync refinements.
